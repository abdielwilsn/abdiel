        I love dreaming up ideas and then engineering them into reality. From
        full-stack apps to AI experiments and random weekend builds, I enjoy
        tinkering, crafting, and breaking things just to rebuild them better.
        I'm always exploring new tech, teaching what I learn, and shipping
        tools that make life a bit easier. Check out what I've been building.

        I write blogs about cool stuff I build, cool things I find while
        working with tools, open source, coding. I also do YouTube from time
        to time.

        Outside coding I also love music (not just consuming but also
        producing) one day I will share this passion. I also love anime. (I
        think Naruto is the greatest anime ever, and I am still
        thinking about Vinland Saga years after.)
